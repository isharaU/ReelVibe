# 🎬 ReelVibe

**ReelVibe** is a modern movie discovery app built with **ReactJS**, designed to help users explore trending films and search for their favorite movies using data from **The Movie Database (TMDB)**. It demonstrates essential React concepts like functional components, props, state, hooks, conditional rendering, and API integration. It also uses **Appwrite** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) to track trending search terms and persist data.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search movies using the TMDB API
- ⚡ Instant UI updates with React’s Virtual DOM
- 🔥 View trending searches based on real user behavior
- 🧠 Functional components with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`
- 📦 Data persistence via **Appwrite**
- ⌨️ Input debouncing for optimized API calls
- 📱 Responsive design & modern styling with Tailwind CSS

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

* **JSX & Functional Components**
* **Props & Component Reuse**
* **React State & `useState`**
* **Side Effects with `useEffect`**
* **Conditional Rendering**
* **Custom Hooks (debounced input)**
* **API Integration & Fetching**
* **Error/loading states**
* **Environment Variables**
* **Using Appwrite for backend logic**

## 📦 Build & Deploy

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Upload the contents of the `/dist` folder to any static hosting service (like Hostinger, Vercel, Netlify, etc).

For secure deployment, consider setting up an **SSL certificate** for HTTPS.
